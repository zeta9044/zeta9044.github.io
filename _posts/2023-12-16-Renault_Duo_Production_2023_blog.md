> The Renault Mobilize Duo, a two-seater electric quadricycle, is scheduled to commence production in 2023. It is designed as a successor to the Renault Twizy and was unveiled at the 2022 Paris Motor Show. The Duo was first previewed by the Mobilize EZ-1 concept in 2021 and was renamed to its current name for its presentation at the 2021 Viva Tech event【6†source】.

The Mobilize Duo is quite compact, measuring 2.43 meters in length and 1.30 meters in width, making it ideal for city use. It will be available in two versions: one with a top speed of 45 km/h and another capable of reaching up to 80 km/h. This variety caters to different market needs, including those of the French market, where vehicles with a top speed of 45 km/h can be driven by individuals as young as 14 without a license, under certain regulations【8†source】.

As for its design, the Mobilize Duo draws inspiration from videogaming and fashion from the 1980s and 1990s. Notably, it features a dashboard styled like a boombox and is customizable. The vehicle is designed with sustainability in mind, with plans to construct it using over 50% recycled materials and ensure that it is 95% recyclable at the end of its service life【8†source】.

In addition to the Duo, a cargo version named the Mobilize Bento was announced. The Bento, expected to be available by 2024, features a large 700-liter cargo box, making it a practical option for various professional uses【7†source】.

The Mobilize Duo won't be available for direct purchase but will be offered to individuals on a subscription basis. This approach is part of Renault's strategy to focus on urban mobility and cater to the changing needs of city dwellers【6†source】.
