## ChatGPT 응답:
> The error message you're encountering, `"Could not parse SQLAlchemy URL from string 'jdbc:oracle:thin:@//192.168.2.69:1521/oracle'"`, suggests there is an issue with the format of the database connection URL you are using in conjunction with SQLAlchemy. SQLAlchemy expects a specific format for database connection URLs which can vary slightly depending on the database.

Here is a breakdown of the issue and how to resolve it:

1. **Incorrect URL Format**: SQLAlchemy uses a slightly different URL format than what you might be used to with other database connectors. The standard SQLAlchemy format for an Oracle connection is generally:

   ```
   dialect+driver://username:password@host:port/sid
   ```

2. **JDBC URL vs. SQLAlchemy URL**: The URL you provided appears to be a JDBC URL, which is commonly used in Java applications but not directly compatible with SQLAlchemy.

3. **Corrected URL Format**: You should modify your URL to match the SQLAlchemy format. Assuming you have the necessary credentials (like username and password), your URL should look something like:

   ```
   oracle+cx_oracle://username:password@192.168.2.69:1521/oracle
   ```

   Here, `oracle+cx_oracle` is the dialect and driver, `username:password` are your database credentials, `192.168.2.69` is the host, `1521` is the port, and `oracle` is the SID or service name.

4. **Dependencies**: Ensure you have the appropriate driver installed for connecting to Oracle. For SQLAlchemy, this often means having `cx_Oracle` installed.

5. **Check for Typos and Credentials**: Verify that there are no typos in your connection string and that your credentials are correct.

6. **Consult Documentation**: If you continue to experience issues, consult the SQLAlchemy documentation for more details on Oracle database connections and ensure that your environment is properly set up for Oracle connectivity.

Remember to replace `username` and `password` with your actual database credentials. If you're using a service name instead of SID, you might need a slightly different format.
