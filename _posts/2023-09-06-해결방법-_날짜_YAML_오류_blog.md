## ChatGPT 응답:
> The error message you've provided is pointing to an issue with the date format in the YAML front matter of your Jekyll post. 

The key line is:
{% raw %}```
Invalid date 'YYYY-MM-DD': Document '_posts/2023-09-06-test-of-post.md' does not have a valid date in the YAML front matter.
```{% endraw %}

Here's how to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:

1. **Check the YAML Front Matter**: The front matter is the metadata at the top of each Jekyll post or page that's surrounded by triple dashes ({% raw %}`---`{% endraw %}). Ensure the date is specified correctly. For instance, if you're writing a post for September 6th, 2023, your YAML front matter should start with:
    {% raw %}```yaml
    ---
    date: 2023-09-06
    ...
    ---
    ```{% endraw %}

2. **Don't Use Placeholders**: The error message mentions the date 'YYYY-MM-DD', which looks like a placeholder. Ensure you're replacing such placeholders with actual dates.

3. **Ensure Consistent Date Formatting**: Make sure that you're using the {% raw %}`YYYY-MM-DD`{% endraw %} format consistently. Avoid using other date formats.

4. **Check for Extra Spaces or Typos**: Ensure there are no extra spaces, typos, or other syntax errors in the YAML front matter.

5. **Verify the Filename**: Jekyll posts should be named in the format {% raw %}`YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.md`{% endraw %}. Ensure that the filename doesn't contain any placeholders and matches the date in the front matter.

6. **Check Global Configurations**: If you have a {% raw %}`_config.yml`{% endraw %} file (which most Jekyll sites do), ensure there are no configurations that might be affecting date parsing.

7. **Update Jekyll and Plugins**: Sometimes, bugs or incompatibilities in older versions can cause issues. Consider updating Jekyll and any plugins to their latest versions.

8. **Local Testing**: Before pushing to your remote repository, test your site locally using {% raw %}`bundle exec jekyll serve`{% endraw %}. This will build your site locally and let you see any errors before they cause failures in a remote build process.

After checking and correcting any issues with the date in the YAML front matter, commit your changes, push them to your repository, and try building your site again.
