> I'm sorry, but it's challenging to find exact price trends for electric wheel motors from 2020 to 2023. The global electric motor market, which includes electric wheel motors, was valued at $106.3 billion in 2020 and is expected to reach $207.3 billion by 2030, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.7% from 2021 to 2030【15†source】. This indicates that the price has been generally increasing during this period, but exact yearly data isn't available.

As for 2023, I found some prices for electric bicycle conversion kits, which often include electric wheel motors:

1. BAFANG E-bike Front Hub Motor 48V 500W Conversion Kit: $466【31†source】.
2. Swytch Universal eBike Conversion Kit: $579【32†source】.
3. AW 26"x1.75" Rear Wheel 48V 1000W Electric Bicycle Motor Kit: $390【33†source】.
4. Rubbee X Conversion Kit: $300【34†source】.

Please note that these prices are for entire conversion kits and not just the motors, and they are also specific to the bicycle market. They may not reflect the broader trends in the electric wheel motor market.
