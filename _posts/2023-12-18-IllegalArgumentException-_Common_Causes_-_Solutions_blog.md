## ChatGPT 응답:
> The error message {% raw %}`java.lang.IllegalArgumentException`{% endraw %} in Java typically indicates that a method has been passed an illegal or inappropriate argument. This exception is a runtime exception, which means it is unchecked and does not need to be declared in a method's {% raw %}`throws`{% endraw %} clause.

Here are some common causes and solutions for this exception:

1. **Invalid Argument Value**: This is the most common cause. Check the values being passed to the method and ensure they are within the expected range or format.

2. **Null Argument**: If a method does not accept {% raw %}`null`{% endraw %} values and one is passed, this exception may be thrown. Ensure that all arguments are properly initialized before calling the method.

3. **API Misuse**: Sometimes, the way a method is called may not align with its intended use as per the API documentation. Review the API documentation for the method in question to ensure correct usage.

4. **State of Object**: In some cases, the state of an object might not be suitable for the operation being performed, leading to this exception.

To resolve the issue, here are some steps you can take:

- **Check Documentation**: Review the API documentation for the method to understand the requirements for the arguments.
- **Debugging**: Use debugging tools to inspect the values of arguments at runtime.
- **Input Validation**: Add checks in your code to validate inputs before they are passed to methods.
- **Error Handling**: Implement error handling to catch and manage this exception appropriately.

If you are facing this issue in a specific context and need more targeted advice, please provide more details about the code or the scenario where you encounter this error.
