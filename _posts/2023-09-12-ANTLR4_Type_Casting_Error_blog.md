## ChatGPT 응답:
> The error message you've provided indicates a `ClassCastException` in Java. Specifically, the code is trying to cast an instance of `CodePointCharStream$CodePoint8BitCharStream` to `TokenStream`, but they are incompatible types.

Here's a brief breakdown:

- `CodePointCharStream` (and its inner class `CodePoint8BitCharStream`) represents a stream of characters, possibly used as input for lexing.
- `TokenStream` represents a stream of tokens, which is typically produced after the lexing phase and consumed during the parsing phase.

The error arises because these are two fundamentally different types of streams in the ANTLR4 framework, and you can't just cast one to the other.

To resolve this issue:

1. **Check the Flow**: Ensure that you're using the streams correctly in the ANTLR4 workflow. Typically, you'd first create a `CharStream` from your input, then pass that to a lexer to produce a `TokenStream`, and finally pass the `TokenStream` to a parser.
2. **Avoid Incorrect Casts**: Ensure that you're not mistakenly trying to cast a `CharStream` to a `TokenStream` or vice versa. Always use appropriate variable types to avoid confusion.

Here's a typical ANTLR4 workflow:

```java
// Create a CharStream from your input
CharStream charStream = CharStreams.fromString(yourInputString);

// Create a lexer with the CharStream
YourLexer lexer = new YourLexer(charStream);

// Create a TokenStream from the lexer
TokenStream tokenStream = new CommonTokenStream(lexer);

// Create a parser with the TokenStream
YourParser parser = new YourParser(tokenStream);

// Start parsing from a rule
YourParser.YourStartRuleContext context = parser.yourStartRule();
```

Make sure your code resembles this workflow, and ensure that you're not trying to cast objects inappropriately.
