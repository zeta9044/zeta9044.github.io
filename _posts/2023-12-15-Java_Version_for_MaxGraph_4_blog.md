## ChatGPT 응답:
> MaxGraph 4, also known as mxGraph 4.2.2, is compatible with Java. However, the specific Java version it supports is not explicitly stated in the available resources. The official [mxGraph documentation](https://jgraph.github.io/mxgraph/) and [mxGraph Java information](https://jgraph.github.io/mxgraph/java/index.html) provide general details about the library but do not specify the exact Java version requirement. Additionally, the [Maven Repository entry for mxGraph 4.2.2](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.nasdanika.core/mxgraph/4.2.2) lists it under Java sources but does not mention a specific Java version.

For precise compatibility details, it's advisable to consult the library's documentation or community forums such as Stack Overflow where mxGraph-related queries are often discussed.
