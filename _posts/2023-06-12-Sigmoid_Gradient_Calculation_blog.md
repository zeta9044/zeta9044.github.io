> function g = sigmoidGradient(z)
%SIGMOIDGRADIENT returns the gradient of the sigmoid function
%evaluated at z
%   g = SIGMOIDGRADIENT(z) computes the gradient of the sigmoid function
%   evaluated at z. This should work regardless if z is a matrix or a
%   vector. In particular, if z is a vector or matrix, you should return
%   the gradient for each element.

g = zeros(size(z));

% ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
% Instructions: Compute the gradient of the sigmoid function evaluated at
%               each value of z (z can be a matrix, vector or scalar).

> To compute the gradient of the sigmoid function evaluated at each value of {% raw %}`z`{% endraw %}, you can use the following code:

{% raw %}```matlab
function g = sigmoidGradient(z)
    % SIGMOIDGRADIENT returns the gradient of the sigmoid function
    % evaluated at z
    
    g = zeros(size(z));

    % Compute the sigmoid function
    sigmoid_z = sigmoid(z);

    % Compute the gradient
    g = sigmoid_z .* (1 - sigmoid_z);

end
```{% endraw %}

In this code, we first initialize {% raw %}`g`{% endraw %} as a matrix of zeros with the same size as {% raw %}`z`{% endraw %}. Then, we compute the sigmoid function {% raw %}`sigmoid_z`{% endraw %} using the {% raw %}`sigmoid`{% endraw %} function (which should be defined separately). Finally, we calculate the gradient by multiplying {% raw %}`sigmoid_z`{% endraw %} element-wise with {% raw %}`(1 - sigmoid_z)`{% endraw %}. This formula works for both matrices and vectors, as it performs element-wise operations.

Make sure you have the {% raw %}`sigmoid`{% endraw %} function implemented correctly, as the gradient calculation relies on it.

> To randomly initialize the weights of a layer with {% raw %}`L_in`{% endraw %} incoming connections and {% raw %}`L_out`{% endraw %} outgoing connections, you can use the following code:

{% raw %}```matlab
function W = randInitializeWeights(L_in, L_out)
    % RANDINITIALIZEWEIGHTS randomly initializes the weights of a layer
    % with L_in incoming connections and L_out outgoing connections

    % Initialize W with zeros
    W = zeros(L_out, 1 + L_in);

    % Randomly initialize the weights
    epsilon_init = 0.12; % range of random values
    W = rand(L_out, 1 + L_in) * 2 * epsilon_init - epsilon_init;

end
```{% endraw %}

In this code, we first initialize {% raw %}`W`{% endraw %} as a matrix of zeros with dimensions {% raw %}`(L_out, 1 + L_in)`{% endraw %}. The {% raw %}`1 + L_in`{% endraw %} accounts for the bias term. Then, we generate random values between {% raw %}`-epsilon_init`{% endraw %} and {% raw %}`epsilon_init`{% endraw %} using the {% raw %}`rand`{% endraw %} function. We multiply the randomly generated values by {% raw %}`2 * epsilon_init`{% endraw %} and subtract {% raw %}`epsilon_init`{% endraw %} to ensure the range is within the desired bounds.

By initializing the weights randomly, we break the symmetry during the training process, which can help the neural network learn more effectively.

% ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
% Instructions: You should complete the code by working through the
%               following parts.
%
% Part 1: Feedforward the neural network and return the cost in the
%         variable J. After implementing Part 1, you can verify that your
%         cost function computation is correct by verifying the cost
%         computed in ex4.m
%
% Part 2: Implement the backpropagation algorithm to compute the gradients
%         Theta1_grad and Theta2_grad. You should return the partial derivatives of
%         the cost function with respect to Theta1 and Theta2 in Theta1_grad and
%         Theta2_grad, respectively. After implementing Part 2, you can check
%         that your implementation is correct by running checkNNGradients
%
%         Note: The vector y passed into the function is a vector of labels
%               containing values from 1..K. You need to map this vector into a 
%               binary vector of 1's and 0's to be used with the neural network
%               cost function.
%
%         Hint: We recommend implementing backpropagation using a for-loop
%               over the training examples if you are implementing it for the 
%               first time.
%
% Part 3: Implement regularization with the cost function and gradients.
%
%         Hint: You can implement this around the code for
%               backpropagation. That is, you can compute the gradients for
%               the regularization separately and then add them to Theta1_grad
%               and Theta2_grad from Part 2.

In this code, the neural network cost function and gradient calculation are implemented in three parts:

1. Feedforward and cost calculation:
   - The forward propagation is performed to compute the hypothesis {% raw %}`h`{% endraw %} of the neural network.
   - The cost {% raw %}`J`{% endraw %} is calculated using the hypothesis and the target output {% raw %}`y`{% endraw %}.
   - The regularization term is computed and added to the cost.

2. Backpropagation and gradient calculation:
   - The backpropagation algorithm is implemented to compute the error terms ({% raw %}`delta3`{% endraw %} and {% raw %}`delta2`{% endraw %}) for each layer.
   - The accumulated gradients ({% raw %}`Delta1`{% endraw %} and {% raw %}`Delta2`{% endraw %}) are computed.
   - The gradients for each weight matrix ({% raw %}`Theta1_grad`{% endraw %} and {% raw %}`Theta2_grad`{% endraw %})
