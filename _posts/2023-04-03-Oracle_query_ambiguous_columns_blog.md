	위 쿼리를 oracle에서 돌리면 ora-00960 에러 발생하는데 원인이 뭐야?

## ChatGPT 응답:
> 

ORA-00960 에러는 "ambiguous column naming in SELECT list" 즉 SELECT 절에 애매한 열 이름이 있어서 생기는 에러입니다. 

이 쿼리에서는 SELECT 절에 동일한 이름으로 중복된 열이나 별칭이 사용되었고, 그 외에도 일부 열 이름은 두 개 이상의 테이블에서 가져온 것이기 때문에 애매한 열 이름이 발생합니다. 

해결 방법으로는 중복된 열 이름을 수정하거나 별칭(alias)을 사용하여 이름을 구분하거나, SELECT 절에서 필요한 열만 선택하여 가져오는 것입니다. 

예를 들어, "mm_abbr_name"와 "mm_object_name" 열은 SELECT 절에서 중복되어 사용되었으며, "MM_CLASS_ID"와 "MM_OBJECT_ID" 열도 여러 테이블에서 가져왔기 때문에 애매한 열 이름이 발생합니다. 

해결책으로는 중복된 열 이름을 수정하거나, 별칭(alias)을 사용하여 이름을 구분하면 됩니다. 

예를 들어, "mm_abbr_name"을 "alias_mm_abbr_name"으로 변경하고, "mm_object_name"을 "alias_mm_object_name"으로 변경하면 다음과 같습니다.
