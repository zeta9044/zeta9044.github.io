## ChatGPT 응답:
> It seems like you're encountering an error related to the JCacheCacheManager in a Spring Boot application. The error message suggests that there's an issue with the configuration of your caching system, specifically the JCacheCacheManager. Let's analyze the error message and find the potential solution:

Error:
{% raw %}`Field jCacheCacheManager in com.datastreams.qtrack.graph.service.FlowCacheServiceImpl required a bean of type 'org.springframework.cache.jcache.JCacheCacheManager' that could not be found.`{% endraw %}

This indicates that the jCacheCacheManager bean is missing in the Spring application context.

Error:
{% raw %}`Bean method 'cacheManager' not loaded because AnyNestedCondition 0 matched 2 did not; NestedCondition on JCacheCacheConfiguration.JCacheAvailableCondition.CustomJCacheCacheManager @ConditionalOnSingleCandidate (types: javax.cache.CacheManager; SearchStrategy: all) did not find any beans; NestedCondition on JCacheCacheConfiguration.JCacheAvailableCondition.JCacheProvider JCache found multiple JSR-107 providers`{% endraw %}

This suggests that there are multiple JSR-107 providers found, and Spring could not decide which one to use as the default.

To resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Make sure you have the required dependencies in your project. If you're using Maven, add the following dependencies to your pom.xml:

{% raw %}```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-cache</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>javax.cache</groupId>
    <artifactId>cache-api</artifactId>
</dependency>
```{% endraw %}

2. Since there are multiple JSR-107 providers found, you need to specify which one to use. You can do this by defining a bean for the JCacheCacheManager in your configuration class. For example, if you're using EhCache as your caching provider, you can add the following code to your configuration:

{% raw %}```java
import org.springframework.cache.jcache.JCacheCacheManager;
import javax.cache.CacheManager;
import javax.cache.Caching;

@Configuration
public class CacheConfig {

    @Bean
    public JCacheCacheManager cacheManager() {
        CacheManager cacheManager = Caching.getCachingProvider("org.ehcache.jsr107.EhcacheCachingProvider")
                .getCacheManager();
        return new JCacheCacheManager(cacheManager);
    }
}
```{% endraw %}

Make sure to replace "org.ehcache.jsr107.EhcacheCachingProvider" with the appropriate caching provider you're using in your application.

3. If you still encounter issues, double-check your application.properties or application.yml file to ensure that it's properly configured for caching. For example, if you're using EhCache, you may need to specify the configuration file like this:

{% raw %}```
spring.cache.jcache.config=classpath:ehcache.xml
```{% endraw %}

Adjust the configuration based on the caching provider you're using in your application.
