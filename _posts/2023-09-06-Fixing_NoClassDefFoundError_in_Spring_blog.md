> Caused by: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Unable to load class org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.socket.AbstractSecurityWebSocketMessageBrokerConfigurer due to missing dependency org/springframework/security/messaging/context/SecurityContextChannelInterceptor


## ChatGPT 응답:
> The error message you're seeing, {% raw %}`java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError`{% endraw %}, typically arises when there is a missing or mismatched library in your classpath.

The specific message suggests that the class {% raw %}`org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.socket.AbstractSecurityWebSocketMessageBrokerConfigurer`{% endraw %} couldn't be loaded because of a missing dependency: {% raw %}`org/springframework/security/messaging/context/SecurityContextChannelInterceptor`{% endraw %}.

Here's a step-by-step guide to troubleshoot and fix the issue:

1. **Ensure You Have the Required Dependencies**: Ensure you have included the necessary Spring Security artifacts in your project. If you're using Maven, your {% raw %}`pom.xml`{% endraw %} should contain dependencies related to Spring Security and WebSockets. For instance:
   {% raw %}```xml
   <dependency>
       <groupId>org.springframework.security</groupId>
       <artifactId>spring-security-messaging</artifactId>
       <version>YOUR_SPRING_SECURITY_VERSION</version>
   </dependency>
   ```{% endraw %}

2. **Version Compatibility**: Ensure that all your Spring dependencies are of compatible versions. Mismatched versions can lead to missing classes or methods. It's typically a good idea to use the same version for all Spring-related dependencies to avoid such issues.

3. **Clean and Rebuild**: Sometimes, IDEs or build tools may have stale or corrupted build artifacts. It's a good idea to:
   - Clean your project (e.g., using {% raw %}`mvn clean`{% endraw %} if you're using Maven).
   - Rebuild the project.
   - Refresh the dependencies (e.g., using {% raw %}`mvn dependency:resolve`{% endraw %} for Maven).

4. **Check Your IDE**: If you're developing in an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse, it may have its own classpath settings which might differ from your build tool (like Maven or Gradle). Ensure that the IDE has correctly imported and recognized all the dependencies.

5. **External Libraries**: If you've added external libraries directly (i.e., not via a build tool like Maven or Gradle), ensure they're still present in the expected directory and haven't been accidentally deleted or moved.

6. **Transitive Dependencies**: Sometimes, one dependency might pull in another (this is called a transitive dependency). It's possible that two of your direct dependencies are pulling in incompatible versions of a third library. You can check this using:
   {% raw %}```shell
   mvn dependency:tree
   ```{% endraw %}
   This will show you all the dependencies and their versions. Look for any version conflicts and resolve them.

7. **Custom Class Loaders**: If your application uses custom class loaders (common in some application servers or OSGi environments), they might interfere with how classes are loaded. Ensure they're configured correctly.

8. **Double-Check Error**: Sometimes, the real cause of an issue might be earlier in the logs. Ensure that there isn't another root error that might be causing this as a side effect.

If you've tried all these steps and are still facing the issue, providing more context about your setup, like your build file ({% raw %}`pom.xml`{% endraw %} or {% raw %}`build.gradle`{% endraw %}), the structure of your project, and the environment in which you're running the application, can help diagnose the issue further.

> 네, 위에서 제시한 Maven 의존성을 Gradle로 변환해보겠습니다.

Maven:
{% raw %}```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.security</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-security-messaging</artifactId>
    <version>YOUR_SPRING_SECURITY_VERSION</version>
</dependency>
```{% endraw %}

Gradle:
{% raw %}```groovy
implementation 'org.springframework.security:spring-security-messaging:YOUR_SPRING_SECURITY_VERSION'
```{% endraw %}

위에서 {% raw %}`YOUR_SPRING_SECURITY_VERSION`{% endraw %} 부분은 실제 사용하고자 하는 Spring Security의 버전으로 바꿔주셔야 합니다. 

이렇게 변환하면, {% raw %}`build.gradle`{% endraw %} 파일에 이 의존성을 추가하실 수 있습니다.
