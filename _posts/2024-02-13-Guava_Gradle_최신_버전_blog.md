## ChatGPT 응답:
> The latest version of the {% raw %}`com.google.guava`{% endraw %} library available as of December 19, 2023, is used in several artifacts like {% raw %}`guava`{% endraw %}, {% raw %}`guava-testlib`{% endraw %}, and {% raw %}`guava-gwt`{% endraw %}. For Gradle dependencies, you can use either {% raw %}`32.0.1-jre`{% endraw %} for standard Java environments or {% raw %}`32.0.1-android`{% endraw %} for Android projects【7†source】【8†source】.

Here's how you can specify the Guava dependency in your Gradle build file:

For standard Java projects:
{% raw %}```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.google.guava:guava:32.0.1-jre'
}
```{% endraw %}

For Android projects:
{% raw %}```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.google.guava:guava:32.0.1-android'
}
```{% endraw %}

Make sure to select the version that best fits your project's requirements.

> The {% raw %}`com.google.guava:guava:32.0.1-jre`{% endraw %} version is designed for Java environments, while the {% raw %}`com.google.guava:guava:32.0.1-android`{% endraw %} version is tailored for Android projects. The "jre" in the version name indicates that this release is intended for use with the Java Runtime Environment, catering to standard Java applications. Conversely, the "android" version is optimized for Android development, addressing compatibility and performance considerations specific to Android platforms.

For Java projects, the JRE version (e.g., {% raw %}`32.0.1-jre`{% endraw %}) suggests compatibility with Java applications running on the Java Runtime Environment. This implies that it is suitable for applications targeting a server or desktop environment where the Java Development Kit (JDK) is available. The specific Java version compatibility (e.g., Java 8, Java 11) for Guava {% raw %}`32.0.1-jre`{% endraw %} would depend on the Guava project's documentation or release notes. Guava often aims to support several recent versions of Java, but for the most accurate and up-to-date compatibility information, reviewing the official Guava GitHub repository or release notes is recommended.

Android projects, on the other hand, should use the Android version (e.g., {% raw %}`32.0.1-android`{% endraw %}), which is optimized for compatibility with the Android SDK and runtime. This version may include optimizations or modifications specific to Android, ensuring that developers can leverage Guava's functionalities without encountering compatibility issues unique to Android's environment.

In summary, when choosing between the {% raw %}`-jre`{% endraw %} and {% raw %}`-android`{% endraw %} versions of Guava, consider the target platform of your application. For Java applications, the {% raw %}`-jre`{% endraw %} version is appropriate, while Android applications should opt for the {% raw %}`-android`{% endraw %} version. For detailed Java version requirements or compatibility specifics, refer to the official Guava documentation or release notes.

## ChatGPT 응답:
> Guava is designed to be used with Java 8 and above. The library provides two different "flavors" to accommodate different environments: one for use on a Java 8+ JRE and one for use on Android or by any library that wants to be compatible with Android. These are specified in the Maven version field as either a {% raw %}`-jre`{% endraw %} suffix for Java environments or an {% raw %}`-android`{% endraw %} suffix for Android environments. This ensures that Guava is compatible with Java 8 and newer versions, offering a robust set of libraries that include new collection types, utilities for concurrency, I/O, hashing, primitives, strings, and more, tailored to the needs of modern Java development【16†source】【17†source】.
