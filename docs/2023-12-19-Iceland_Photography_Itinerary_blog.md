### Day 1: The Golden Circle
- **Þingvellir National Park**: Start your day early at Þingvellir, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It's a place of great geological and historical significance. Capture the beauty of the Almannagjá gorge, the site of the ancient Icelandic parliament, and the contrast between the North American and Eurasian tectonic plates.
- **Geysir Geothermal Area**: Next, head to the Geysir Geothermal Area. The main attractions here are the geysers, particularly Strokkur, which erupts every few minutes. The steam and eruptions make for dynamic photographs.
- **Gullfoss Waterfall**: Conclude your day at Gullfoss, one of Iceland's most iconic waterfalls. The powerful falls create a photogenic mist that's perfect for capturing dramatic shots, especially in the golden hours.

### Day 2: South Coast Adventure
- **Seljalandsfoss and Skógafoss Waterfalls**: Start your day with these two famous waterfalls. Seljalandsfoss offers a unique opportunity to walk behind the falls, while Skógafoss is known for its sheer power and often produces rainbows in sunny weather.
- **Reynisfjara Black Sand Beach**: Visit this famous beach near Vík with its unique black sand, powerful waves, and basalt columns. The nearby cliffs and sea stacks are also worth capturing.
- **Dyrhólaey**: End your day at Dyrhólaey, a small peninsula known for its stunning views of the coastline, lighthouse, and the chance to photograph puffins during the nesting season.

### Day 3: The East and Jökulsárlón
- **Fjaðrárgljúfur Canyon**: Start your day with a visit to this majestic canyon. The serpentine shape and steep walls make for great landscape photos.
- **Skaftafell in Vatnajökull National Park**: Hike in Skaftafell and photograph the landscape dominated by Vatnajökull glacier. Don't miss the Svartifoss waterfall, surrounded by basalt columns.
- **Jökulsárlón Glacier Lagoon and Diamond Beach**: Conclude your trip at the glacier lagoon and the nearby Diamond Beach. Icebergs of various shapes and sizes on the black sand beach offer endless photographic opportunities, especially during sunset.
