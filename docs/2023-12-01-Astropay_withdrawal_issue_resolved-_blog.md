> 나는 한국에서 계속 astropay로 deposit/withdraw를 bank transfer로 하고 있다.  deposit은 bank transfer로  현재도 잘 되고 있는데, 2023년 11월28일부터 withdraw만 bank transfer가 안되고 앱에서는 일시적으로 중단되었다고 나온다.  10월에도 비슷한 일이 있었는데, 즉 장애였는데 공지없이 슬그머니 정상화됐었다. 그래서, 이번에는 언제 장애가 해결되서 정상적으로 이용할 수 있는지 물었는데 엉뚱하게  "We regret to inform you that the document submitted was not accepted!". 이게 무슨 소리냐?

## ChatGPT 응답:
> I've been continuously using Astropay for deposit and withdrawal through bank transfer in South Korea. Deposits via bank transfer are still working well, but since November 28, 2023, withdrawals have been temporarily suspended, as indicated in the app. A similar incident occurred in October, where it was a technical issue that was resolved without any official announcement. Therefore, I inquired about when this current issue would be resolved to resume normal services. In response, I received an irrelevant message stating, "We regret to inform you that the document submitted was not accepted!". What does this mean? I am quite displeased with this response. Sarah Morgan from the Customer Support Operation Team, I express my deep regret about this situation.
