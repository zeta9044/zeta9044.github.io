## ChatGPT 응답:
> The exception "java.io.UnsupportedEncodingException: ko_KR.UTF-8" typically occurs when attempting to use an unsupported character encoding in Java. In this case, it suggests that the encoding "ko_KR.UTF-8" is not supported by the Java runtime environment.

Java supports a set of standard character encodings, such as UTF-8, UTF-16, ISO-8859-1, and more. However, the specific encoding "ko_KR.UTF-8" seems to be a locale-specific encoding for Korean text in the Korean language. It's possible that this encoding is not available or recognized by the Java installation on your system.

To resolve this issue, you can try using one of the standard encodings supported by Java that is suitable for Korean text. The most common encoding for Korean is UTF-8, which should be widely supported. Instead of "ko_KR.UTF-8", you can use "UTF-8" as the encoding name in your Java code.

Here's an example of how you can specify the encoding as UTF-8 when working with file input/output in Java:

```java
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.BufferedWriter;
import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.io.OutputStreamWriter;

public class EncodingExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String filePath = "path/to/your/file.txt";

        try {
            // Reading a file with UTF-8 encoding
            BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(
                new InputStreamReader(
                    new FileInputStream(filePath), "UTF-8"
                )
            );

            // Writing a file with UTF-8 encoding
            BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(
                new OutputStreamWriter(
                    new FileOutputStream(filePath), "UTF-8"
                )
            );

            // Perform read/write operations...

            reader.close();
            writer.close();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

By using "UTF-8" as the encoding name, you should be able to read and write Korean text without encountering the "java.io.UnsupportedEncodingException" exception.
